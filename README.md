# Customer-Segmentation-Analysis-using-RFM
This project performs customer segmentation using transaction data with RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) analysis. A Python-based solution automates the process, providing deeper insights for targeted marketing and customer retention strategies.


Lets create a comprehensive customer segmentation analysis using your transaction data. Let's break this down into steps and create a Python solution that implements RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) analysis along with additional insights from your rich dataset.

Here's how to proceed with your customer segmentation analysis:

Data Preparation:
First, ensure your data is clean and properly formatted.
Convert transaction dates to datetime format.
Handle any missing values or duplicates.

The code performs several key analyses:
RFM Analysis (Recency, Frequency, Monetary value).
Brand loyalty analysis.
Category diversity analysis.
Retailer diversity analysis.

The segmentation creates five distinct customer groups:
High Volume Explorer: Frequent shoppers who try different brands.
Brand Loyal Power User: Frequent shoppers loyal to specific brands.
Recent Casual Shopper: New or recently active customers.

Category Explorer: Customers who shop across many categories
Occasional Buyer: Infrequent shoppers
